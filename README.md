## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Example App: **Snapchat**
    - The animations when switching between screens
    - The ability to swipe with one finger to get to almost every screen on the app for fast navigation
    
Example App: **Canvas Student**
    - Easy to navigate between classes on home screen
    - Calendar for seeing important due dates
    - ToDo list for Homework assignments due for the week
    
Example App: **Telegram**
    - Ability to change background of chats
    - Ability to change app icon
    - Accesibility feature for chnaging size of font only for the app.
    
App Idea:
    I would like to build similar features like Telegrams ability to change the app icon and change the theme for specific chats. I want to understand how its possible to make user changeable features to customize the way the app looks and feel so people can create an asthetic they feel is enjoyable to experience the app they are using. I want to make the app feel like the users in charge rather than using the same old black and white color theme most apps use.
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The only issue i ran into while putting the app together was figuring out how to get the text to change color by the user.
